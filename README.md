# APLUX Model Farm

## Overview

To accelerate evaluation AI model performance on target edge devices, APLUX builds the [Model Farm](https://aiot.aidlux.com/en/models). Model Farm contains hundreds of mainstream open-source models with different functions, optimized for different hardware platforms, and provides benchmark performance reference based on real testing. Developers can quickly finish evaluations according to their actual requirements without investing substantial costs and time costs.

At the same time, Model Farm also provides ready-to-run model inference example code, greatly reducing the difficulty and workload for developers to test model performance and develop AI application on edge devices, shortening the entire process time and accelerating solution deployment.

## Features

Specifically, Model Farm can help developers accomplish the following:

- Query AI model performance reference on specific Qualcomm chip
- Download optimized AI models (leveraging NPU for acceleration inference)
- Download pre/post-processing and model inference example code
- View model conversion & optimization steps, which help developers to optimize their own fine-tuned models quickly
